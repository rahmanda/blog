According to [schema.org](https://schema.org/Article), a `publisher` property can be filled with either `Organization` or `Person` type. However when I was trying to use `Person` type on this web's schema, the Google's [structured data testing tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/) said it was invalid. Therefore, I can only use `Organization` type for a publisher, which I opted out later and just use `author` property. This could be either schema.org who needs to fix the documentation, or Google who needs to fix the testing tool hmmm....
