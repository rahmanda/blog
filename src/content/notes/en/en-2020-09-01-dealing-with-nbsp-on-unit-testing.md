Sometimes we need to use `&nbsp;` in our HTML as opposed to a space. However because `&nbsp;` has a different byte code, the comparison between `&nbsp;` and a space will always return false. That's why if we want to do assertion with an HTML text containing `&nbsp;` characters, we need to replace spaces with `\u00a0` (`&nbsp;` will be transformed to unix code when rendered).

```js
const mount = function render() {
  return <p>&nbsp;</p>;
};

const wrapper = mount();

expect(wrapper.text()).toBe(" "); // false
expect(wrapper.text()).toBe("\u00a0"); // true
```
