I just realized that martabak asin in Indonesia was originated from Arab cuisine 'murtabbaq' from watching [Geography Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP68QwVvAZk) video on Youtube. However, martabak manis or terang bulan was originated from Chinese cuisine ['Man Jian Guo'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apam_balik). The thing is, martabak asin and manis are almost always sold together by the same street vendor in Indonesia. Thus after all this time, the martabak vendor sells two things with entirely different cultures.

I wonder what was the history behind martabak vendor started to sell these foods together back in the days....
