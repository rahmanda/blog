My personal homepage and blog. Use [gridsome](https://gridsome.org) for static site generator, [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling and [prismjs](https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/remark-prismjs) for syntax highlighting (with [vs code theme](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/blob/master/themes/prism-vsc-dark-plus.css)).

To run in your local machine, run `yarn` to install dependencies. After that, run `yarn dev` and open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
